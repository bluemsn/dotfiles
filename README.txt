This repo contains my dotfiles folder that I keep at `~/dotfiles`.

If you want to use it just clone it to your own computer with:

    git clone https://github.com/Greduan/dotfiles.git

If you feel like contributing to my dotfiles (my environment), i.e. by
recommending a better alternative to something or by fixing some bad code or
something like that just make a pull request or open a new issue and I'll check
it out.
